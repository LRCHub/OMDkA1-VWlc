When you get to the top
You've ever been to the top
Just listen, let me tell ya
Hear what you're missin'
Shut up and listen
In the beginning you get crazy
Spending all the money you got
No more women to love you now
You gotta go and leave town
Back on the rocks
Back on the rocks babe!
You got to keep
your mind together
Back on the rocks
Back on the rocks babe!
You gotta go and live forever
When your back on the rocks
It means you've been
to the top
Just listen to the fact boy
Given the fact of
it could be all gone
In the beginning you get crazy
Spending all the money you got
No more women to love you now
You gotta go and leave town
Back on the rocks
Back on the rocks babe!
You got to keep
your mind together
Back on the rocks
Back on the rocks babe!
You gotta go and live forever
Back on the rocks
Back on the rocks babe!
You got to keep
your mind together
Back on the rocks
Back on the rocks babe!
You gotta go and live forever
When you get to the top
You've ever been to the top?
Just listen, let me tell ya
Hear what you're missin'
Shut up and listen
In the beginning you get crazy
Spending all the money you got
No more women to love you now
You gotta go and leave town
Back on the rocks
Back on the rocks babe!
Back on the rocks
Back on the rocks babe!

Back on the rocks babe!
You got to keep
