When you get to the top
You ever been to the top?
Just listen... let me tell ya
Hear what you're missin'
Shut up and listen
In the beginning you get crazy
Spending all the money you got
No more women to love you now
You gotta go and leave town

Back on the rocks
Back on the rocks, baby!
You've gotta keep your mind together
Back on the rocks
Back on the rocks, baby!
You've gotta go and live forever
Back on the rocks
Back on the rocks, baby!
You've gotta keep your mind together
Back on the rocks
Back on the rocks, baby!
You've gotta go and live forever

When you're back on the rocks
It means you've been to the top
Just listen... to the bad boy
Givin' the facts on
It can be all gone
In the beginning you get crazy
Spending all the money you got
No more women to love you now
You gotta go and leave town

Back on the rocks
Back on the rocks, baby!
You've gotta keep your mind together
Back on the rocks
Back on the rocks, baby!
You've gotta go and live forever
Back on the rocks
Back on the rocks, baby!
You've gotta keep your mind together
Back on the rocks
Back on the rocks, baby!
You've gotta go and live forever

Back on the rocks
Back on the rocks
Woah, wo-o-oah
Back on the rocks
Back on the rocks
Woah, wo-o-oah
